# Network-Intrusion-Detection
A machine learning-based system to detect malicious network activities. This project analyzes network traffic and classifies it as normal or intrusive using supervised learning models.
The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and a ‘good (normal) connections’.
